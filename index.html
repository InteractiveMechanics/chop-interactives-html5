        I would be a bit more explicit with naming here. For instance:
        stage = background_stage
        left = left_curtain
        center = center_curtain
        right = right_curtain

        Later, you'll probably have a few other canvases:
        left_character
        center_character
        right_character
    -->
    <canvas id="stage"></canvas>
	<canvas id="left"></canvas>
	<canvas id="center"></canvas>
	<canvas id="right"></canvas>

	<script type="text/javascript" src="./stage.js"></script>
</body>
