# chop-interactives-html5
## About this repo
This repo is mostly for the HTML5 canvas development for the CHOP interactives. Eventually, we'll need to add in the Kinect controls for the interactive elements, but for now we can test with mouse and keyboard controls.

## Running locally
*  Run a simple server (python -m SimpleHTTPServer) in the root directory
*  Each interactive has their own directory, like '/climb' or '/row'
*  There is a shared resource directory for any shared assets and resources
